Previously on The Ark...

As of this moment, you are no
longer an officer on this ship.

3

After what they did to me, my only
remaining loyalty lies with you.

4
00:00:07,147 --> 00:00:09,602
- I have Klampkins disease.
- There's no cure.

- [GRUNTS]
- Brice!

6
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:13,054
I knew someone who had Klampkins.

7
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,134
- You gave him a death sentence.
- EVA: It was just sex.

8
00:00:15,176 --> 00:00:16,882
Oh, yeah, just sex.

9
00:00:16,922 --> 00:00:20,708
The archives from Ark 3 might
have the cure for Klampkins.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,746
I don't want to die, but I'm going to.

11
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,786
ALICIA: Our ark and Ark 3
were hit by the same substance.

12
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:27,573
The chemical came from a
weapon mounted on Ark 15.

13
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:31,608
How's the Juno Project going?

14
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:33,979
Can we forget about work
just for a little while?

15
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:42,424
So as you can see, despite
yesterday's incident,

16
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:44,420
the FTL's negative energy feedback

17
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,542
regenerated enough fuel
for us to activate it again.

18
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:48,372
- We get lucky.
- Extremely.

19
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:51,034
And once we're underway, we'll
be in Proxima B in no time.

20
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:54,362
- [CHEERING]
- All right, all right. Not so fast.

21
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,484
First we need Eva to give
the drive a once-over.

22
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:59,021
You want to check my work?

23
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:02,183
I wanna throw you back
in your cryo pod, mate,

24
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:04,555
- but apparently that's elder abuse.
- I think it won't hurt

25
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:06,551
having another pair of
eyes look things over.

26
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:11,003
If that's the way you want to use
your crew's valuable time, so be it.

27
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:15,870
Stop, stop! Don't start the
drive. I know where Ark 15 is.

28
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:21,918
I studied its trajectory as it dropped

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,981
out of light speed to attack Ark 3.

30
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:28,641
That's Ark 15, and that's Ark 3.

31
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:32,843
And that's Ark 1 when we were attacked.

32
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:36,587
- Brilliant, Miss Nevins.
- Oh, thank you.

33
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:39,248
Could you explain it for the
non-navigation wonks among us?

34
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,289
Oh, right.

35
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,993
Um, Ark 15 attacked us,

36
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,533
and then it attacked Ark 3.

37
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:46,944
Three points in a row
make a straight line

38

or a course heading. If
you follow it through,

39
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:50,980
- then...
- It goes straight to Proxima B.

40
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:54,183
Yes. That's where Ark 15 went.

41
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:57,469
So, if we go to Prox B,

42
00:01:57,512 --> 00:01:58,968
we're running straight towards the ship

43

<i>[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]</i>

45

- And they did kill Ark 3.
- And we still have no idea why?

No, and it's unlikely we'll
be as lucky a second time.

48

Not as long as they have
the Aliciaminium weapon.

49
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:37,663
I've given up trying to fight it.

50
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:39,459
I can't believe I'm saying this.

We might have to change course.

The next inhabitable

We can't do that. It'll
add years to our journey.

54
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:50,683
- This ship is in bad shape.
- I don't like it either, but it's the safest...

55
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:53,103
It's unacceptable. We cannot allow it.

Mr. and Mrs. Trust, you are
in this meeting as a courtesy.

- You don't get a vote.
- A vote? So let me get this straight.

58
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:02,270
You have such little
faith in your leadership

59
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:03,439
that you put things up for a vote?

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,443
It's called democracy, dipshit.

61
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:08,280
Show them your plan, honey.

62

What is this?

65
00:03:15,832 --> 00:03:17,836
It looks like a design for a shield.

66
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:20,716
It uses the FTL's
space distortion bubble.

67
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:22,134
According to this, it
would maintain the bubble

68

upon arrival at the
destination to act as a shield.

69

- It could work.
- Could? We don't know?

We can't risk everyone's lives
on an idea that might work.

00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:34,361
I would risk my life on this.

I choose Garnet every time.

I don't like the idea of
adding years to the trip,

Lieutenant Garnet's judgment.

Oh, I see.

We did. And rejected it.

Alicia, I need you to
do something for me.

Most people just throw seeds in

That's kind of a beautiful thing.

So, will any of this work on Prox B?

107
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:26,612
Uh, it'll have different soil,

108
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:29,283
which means different vegetation.

00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:33,415
- But will it be safe for humans?
- Maybe. Maybe not.

That's why we need someone

I was, but this is me trying
to be the bigger person.

156
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,648
for Ark 3 as a starting point.

157
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,317
It seemed like you were
partial to modified octal codes.

158
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:44,161
And I'm not a child.

159
00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:51,754
Thank you for your assistance
with the Maddox retrofit.

160
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,759
Your services are no
longer needed on the bridge.

161
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:06,318
TRUST: She used a child to humiliate me.

162
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,613
I don't agree with how she did it,

163
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:09,490
but I know she wasn't
trying to humiliate you.

164
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,785
You know?

165
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:13,871
Garnet does what she
thinks is best for the crew,

166
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:17,001
- even when she's wrong.
- Bloody well right, she's wrong.

167
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:18,629
How many more people
will die on this ship

168
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:21,008
if we spend at least
another two years here?

169
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:22,759
That's blood on her hands.

170
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:24,346
That's blood on all our hands.

171
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:28,184
If we have the power to
stop her and we don't do it,

172
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:29,770
doesn't that make us complicit?

173
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:31,731
What are you saying?

174
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:36,197
You're a good person, Will.

175
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:38,450
You tried do it nice way.

176
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:42,029
Now it's time to do it the painful way.

177
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,998
This is the right move.

178
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:01,941
Attention all hands, this is Garnet.

179
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:06,279
<i>We have evidence to suggest
Ark 15 is at Proxima B.</i>

180
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:08,990
<i>They tried to destroy us once.</i>

181
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,910
<i>There's no reason to think
they won't try again.</i>

182
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:14,664
<i>We have no reliable defense
against their weapon.</i>

183
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:16,458
<i>This forces Lieutenant Brice and me</i>

184
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,835
<i>to make a difficult decision.</i>

185
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:21,965
We are altering course for Ross 128B.

186
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:26,135
<i>Unfortunately, this will
add years to our journey.</i>

187
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:29,474
<i>The risk of continuing to
Proxima is too dangerous,</i>

188
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:32,476
<i>which makes the decision simple.</i>

189
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,605
<i>We are better safe than dead.</i>

190
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:37,274
<i>Brace for jump to FTL.</i>

191
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:45,450
Hey, I trust your instincts.

192
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:53,250
Eva, activate FTL.

193
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:56,922
- Is there problem?
- No, Lieutenant.

194
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:25,163
Hey.

195
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:30,461
Hey.

196
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:37,885
It's just real now, you know?

197
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:43,725
We're going to Ross 128,
and I'm never make it.

198
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:46,227
Why didn't you try to
talk Garnet out of it?

199
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:50,359
No, come on. Eva, she's right.

200
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,195
And I'm not willing to sacrifice
the crew for my own selfish reasons.

201
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:02,914
In my professional opinion,
Garnet has lost her mind.

202
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,917
We've been at light
speed for over a week,

203
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,543
and she's just pretending
it's business as usual.

204
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:11,131
- Garnet doesn't care that no one wants to go to Ross.
- Aren't we past that?

205
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:14,802
I mean, it was too
dangerous to go to Prox B.

206
00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:17,597
There's danger at every planet.

207
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,934
At least at Prox B we would've had
a shield to protect us from Ark 15.

208
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:22,812
Wait. We have a shield?

209
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,940
We would've.

210
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,774
Designed by William Trust himself.

211
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:29,486
What will Garnet do
when we get to Ross 128

212
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:30,528
and there's more trouble?

213
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:31,905
We'll just change course again?

214
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:34,616
The way she's acting? I
wouldn't put it past her.

215
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:36,495
We may never get off this ship.

216
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:43,293
- I can't believe this.
- What are we gonna do?

217
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:44,962
Someone needs to stand up to her.

218
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:47,173
How long will we survive
on this deathtrap?

219
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,304
- Damn it!
- Everything okay?

220
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:56,643
It's my WD. I can't get it to work.

221
00:12:56,684 --> 00:12:58,144
Oh, you can just get another one.

222
00:12:58,186 --> 00:13:01,398
This one's from Ark 3.
The tech's more advanced.

223
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,193
- Oh.
- Clearer audio, stronger signal, subspace able.

224
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,741
And it's the last
thing I have from there.

225
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:12,452
I'm sorry. I didn't
even think about that.

226
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:15,581
Hey, maybe you could
fix it? You're so smart.

227
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh, well, sorry.

228
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:21,337
I know how to use one
of those, not fix one.

229
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:24,299
But I bet one of the
engineers could fix it.

230
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:38,691
Double-checking my work?

231
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:40,860
Can I help you? I have work to do.

232
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:44,365
Lane's been updating
me on all the challenges

233
00:13:44,405 --> 00:13:47,868
that you've faced since waking up.

234
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:50,621
I'm amazed at how you've
held this ark together.

235
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,374
You're the best engineer on the ship.

236
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,293
I'm the only one left.

237
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:57,254
But now you're the best
engineer on the ship.

238
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,966
My dear, I'm the best
engineer in the galaxy.

239
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,015
I know why you're here.

240
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:12,605
We're going to Ross, and
you need to accept it.

241
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:14,148
Do you accept it?

242
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,446
For a junior level engineer,

243
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:22,741
you've performed miracles by
holding this ship together.

244
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:28,248
But tell me, how many more
do you think you have in you?

245
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:31,085
- We're a team. We all...
- You're smarter than that.

246
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:34,087
This is your ship. Think.

247
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:36,508
Do you honestly believe it
will last years at light speed?

248
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:52,275
Please eat, dear.

249
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,447
I'm sorry, it's just I never thought

250
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:58,575
I'd have the chance to
meet you and Mr. Trust,

251
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:01,577
- let alone eat lunch with you.
- No need to apologize.

252
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:05,249
I'm flattered that you
hold us in such high esteem.

253
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,297
- Not everyone does, you know.
- Why not?

254
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:13,133
Mr. Trust is a brilliant man
trying to save the human race.

255
00:15:13,174 --> 00:15:15,970
Some people still blame poor
William for Klampkins syndrome.

256
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:17,804
He was trying to save Earth.

257
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:21,433
If the decarbonization had worked,
they'd have called him a hero.

258
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:23,604
Truer words.

259
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:33,530
Can I ask you a question? How is Felix?

260
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,913
He...

261
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:41,289
He asked me not to
talk about him with you.

262
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,212
I'm just worried about him.

263
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,133
I knew his family.

264
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:54,471
Robert and Katheryn were
such beautiful souls.

265
00:15:56,392 --> 00:16:01,020
- He's having a hard time.
- I thought so.

266
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:02,356
It explains a lot.

267
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,153
Felix is making emotional decisions.

268
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:12,201
And emotional decisions are dangerous.

269
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:13,494
Wouldn't you agree?

270
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:25,341
Kabir has put in a fourth
request for another set of hands.

271
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:27,051
We have to reassign someone
before Dr. Kabir has...

272
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:29,053
Lieutenants, rumor is Trust

273
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:30,264
came up with a shield against Ark 15.

274
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:33,683
- Is this true?
- He had a theory.

275
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:35,729
- There's no way to test it.
- But it could work?

276
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:38,648
We don't know. The only way to
find out is to risk all our lives.

277
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,318
So you just gave up and added
years to the mission? That's crap!

278
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,613
Oi! You watch your tone.

279
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:48,241
I understand. You're pissed.
Hell, I'm pissed, too.

280
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:50,537
A lot of people are wondering
if you added years to the trip

281
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:53,373
because you'll have to give up
command when we're on the planet.

282
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:56,461
I think it's time you go
back to your station, ensign.

283
00:16:56,501 --> 00:17:00,548
- Most of the crew don't want this.
- Too bad.

284
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,259
My job isn't to give you what you want.

285
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,135
My job is to give you what you need.

286
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:07,306
Then maybe you should lose your job.

287
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:19,944
Security, report to corridor 31B.

288
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:22,490
We have a couple of gentlemen
cooling off waiting for you.

289
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:24,951
If we don't get the crew on our side,

290
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:26,060
we're not gonna last another two years.

291
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:31,340
KABIR: There's no sign of a concussion.

292
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:32,750
You're very lucky.

293
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,173
That's me, luckiest woman on Ark 1.

294
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:39,011
Well, I mean, Cat's rich and famous,

295
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:41,182
and wasn't experimented on as a child,

296
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:43,144
but you're a close second.

297
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,859
Sorry, but we ran out of wound glue,

298
00:17:46,902 --> 00:17:48,697
so I'll have to sew you
up the old fashioned way.

299
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:50,326
But don't worry, I numbed it.

300
00:17:56,671 --> 00:18:00,220
- Um, maybe I should do this.
- Just give me a moment.

301
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,058
- I can...
- It's fine, okay?

302
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:04,310
You're going through a lot.

303
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:07,607
Thank you.

304
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:19,882
How's recovery going?

305
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:22,430
As you can see, not fast enough.

306
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:25,183
Whatever you need, I'm here for you.

307
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:29,358
- I appreciate that. Cat's been helping.
- Hmm.

308
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,945
She's holding onto the key to the meds.

309
00:18:30,988 --> 00:18:34,076
It helps with the temptation.

310
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:41,382
But I still have a long way to go.

311
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,644
Hey. I heard about Garnet.

312
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:49,063
I just wanted to check in.

313
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:52,028
- So now you care?
- That's not what I meant.

314
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:55,618
I was hoping the attack might've
made you reconsider Proxima B.

315
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,499
- Mr. Trust still thinks...
- I don't give two shits what that man thinks.

316
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:02,339
- Yeah, but the crew...
- Don't get a vote, just like Trust.

317
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:04,844
Is this about your belief in
Garnet or your hatred for Trust?

318
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:09,645
- Both.
- You do know he's the reason you're alive, right?

319
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:11,650
You'd be dead back on Earth
if it wasn't for Mr. Trust.

320
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:13,528
You should be thanking
him for saving your life.

321
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:15,990
Yeah, well, I'll tell that to
all the people dying of Klampkins.

322
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:19,121
That was an accident. It doesn't
discount all the good he's done.

323
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:21,209
Oh, yes, it does.

324
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,212
And to be perfectly honest, mate,

325
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:25,342
I really don't understand
your blind faith in him.

326
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:29,392
I owe everything to Trust.

327
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:31,061
I couldn't have afforded the academy

328
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,567
without a Trust Industries scholarship.

329
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,528
He's the reason I'm in the GSA.

330
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:40,788
Yeah, well, he's also the
reason you're now a civilian.

331
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:55,734
- Helena Trust asked about you again.
- I'm sure she did.

332
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:57,487
Thank you for continuing
to look after them.

333
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,866
She says you're making
emotional decisions.

334
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:04,876
Yes, I'm well known for my histrionics.

335
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,344
I know your relationship's complicated,

336
00:20:09,384 --> 00:20:11,640
but as a council member,
you need to see past that.

337
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:15,146
You're referring to the
decision to go to Ross 128B?

338
00:20:15,189 --> 00:20:17,317
Mr. Trust had a plan for Ark 15.

339
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,728
The decision was made
and we're underway.

340
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:23,398
Now we need to present a united front.

341
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:25,612
The first couple of weeks
will be tough, and...

342
00:20:28,784 --> 00:20:32,875
- Is it hot in here?
- Have more water.

343
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:39,890
It's so hot.

344
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,063
Where did everyone...

345
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:46,027
What?

346
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:50,743
- Jelena.
- I'm really sorry, boss,

347
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:52,538
but you're making emotional decisions.

348
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,125
You would've gotten in his way

349
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,048
and maybe even gotten hurt yourself.

350
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,510
This way is better.

351
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:08,152
Well, if that was the actual last time

352
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:11,075
then at least we, you know...

353
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:14,832
[WHISTLES] ... topped ourselves.

354
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:19,340
Okay, that really was
the last time we do this.

355
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:21,051
Right, I'm just... thank you.

356
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:23,347
I'm just saying, you know,

357
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,854
if you were to ever change your mind,

358
00:21:25,894 --> 00:21:29,987
then you know exactly where to find me.

359
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:35,497
After today, you'll never
want to speak to me again.

360
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,426
- Why wouldn't I talk to you?
- Because Trust is right.

361
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:46,184
Ark 1 will never make it to Ross 128.

362
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:49,441
- You'll never make it.
- Eva, what the hell are you talking about?

363
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:52,739
Trust is a monster. He's...

364
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:55,869
Eva?

365
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:59,167
Eva, what the hell did you do?

366
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,881
- You're just going to sleep.
- What did you do?

367
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,723
It was the only way to protect you.

368
00:22:13,403 --> 00:22:17,118
CAT: How's the head?

369
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:20,792
It hurts. On a lot of levels.

370
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:22,505
You feel like the crew
doesn't have your back?

371
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:27,096
I know I made the right decision,

372
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:30,769
but I also know a lot
people hate me now, so...

373
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:34,109
May I offer a different view?

374
00:22:35,864 --> 00:22:39,119
Maybe this is so tough
because you're wrong.

375
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,172
No, um, the safety of the crew is...

376
00:22:47,385 --> 00:22:49,848
I don't feel, um...

377
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:52,353
I need to go see Dr. Kabir.
I might have a concussion.

378
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:53,940
Oh, no, no, no. Sit down, sit down.

379
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:56,194
I have some water. I'll call Kabir.

380
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:59,284
No, I should walk

381
00:22:59,326 --> 00:23:02,999
so I don't pass out.

382
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:11,223
You didn't use enough.

383
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,603
You should've taken into
account my enhancements.

384
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:21,576
[GRUNTING]

385
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:22,871
I did anticipate them.

386
00:23:33,808 --> 00:23:34,721
I'm really sorry.

387
00:23:38,313 --> 00:23:40,320
Um, I don't think that
they're supposed to be here.

388
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,355
Take your station, Alicia.

389
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:46,736
Do it.

390
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:53,998
Initiating FTL recharge.

391
00:23:57,086 --> 00:23:59,173
Attention, Ark 1,

392
00:23:59,213 --> 00:24:01,009
this is Lieutenant Lane to all hands.

393
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:04,890
Due to an unfortunate lack in judgment,

394
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:07,230
Lieutenant Brice, Garnet, and Strickland

395
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,895
have all been relieved of duty.

396
00:24:08,936 --> 00:24:11,232
- What? You can't...
- Shh, shh, shh, Don't worry, Alicia.

397
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:14,321
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- It is my reluctant obligation

398
00:24:14,323 --> 00:24:15,615
to take command of Ark 1,

399
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:19,119
and my first order is that we
resume our mission to Proxima B.

400
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:21,374
Now, thanks to Mr. Trust's genius,

401
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:24,586
we have a plan to shield ourselves.

402
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:27,548
Once the FTL is charged,
we'll be underway.

403
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,471
Lane out.

404
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,809
If anyone has a problem,
you can be reassigned.

405
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:36,480
Otherwise, back to your stations.

406
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:40,068
You made the right
choice, Lieutenant Lane.

407
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,363
Thank you, Mr. Stein.

408
00:24:42,865 --> 00:24:45,576
I believe that that chair is yours.

409
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:48,833
No, I'm just a lieutenant.

410
00:24:48,874 --> 00:24:51,836
- You are the captain.
- Except I'm not.

411
00:24:51,877 --> 00:24:54,799
I'm just doing what has to be
done to keep this crew safe.

412
00:24:56,469 --> 00:24:58,471
Men and their pride.

413
00:25:01,685 --> 00:25:05,858
- It's just a chair.
- No one's sat in that chair since Captain Lester died.

414
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,114
Then no one will mind if I take it.

415
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,494
[POUNDING ON DOOR]

416
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:20,131
Oh. Oh, man, I feel
like I went on a bender.

417
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,721
The headache wears off in a minute.

418
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:27,558
But the rage and sense
of betrayal will stay.

419
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:28,894
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

420
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:32,148
I was with... I was with Eva and then...

421
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:35,904
- Trust.
- And Lane.

422
00:25:35,945 --> 00:25:39,035
- He's taken command.
- Soon we'll change course to Prox B.

423
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,672
- Shit! No!
- Easy, Brice!

424
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,926
We're all angry, but we've
gotta stay level-headed.

425
00:25:49,968 --> 00:25:52,055
Now everyone's gonna die on
this ship. It's not just me.

426
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:54,016
- It won't just be me.
- You're not making any sense.

427
00:25:54,057 --> 00:25:55,267
The sedatives are probably
still in your system.

428
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:56,811
I've got Klampkins!

429
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,736
I'm going to die because of him.

430
00:26:03,655 --> 00:26:04,990
And now everyone else is, too.

431
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:15,214
- I'm so sorry about...
- It's okay. It's okay.

432
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:23,227
- It's okay.
- That man has hurt us all.

433
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:31,865
Tell you what, when we get out of this,

434
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:35,246
you get to be the one to
lay Trust out on his ass.

435
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,002
Well, you just gave me a reason to live.

436
00:26:48,348 --> 00:26:51,354
Amazing. How did you get all this?

437
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:53,148
You know me. I make friends everywhere.

438
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:57,154
This is like old times,
but with less champagne.

439
00:26:57,197 --> 00:27:00,535
I really wanted to thank
you for all your help.

440
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:02,413
When William assigned
you Garnet, I was worried.

441
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,169
Oh, Sharon would never hurt
me. It's not in her nature.

442
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:11,218
You know they're good
people, right? Just misguided.

443
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:13,680
Hmm. Of course.

444
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:18,311
Once we're safe on
Proxima, they'll understand.

445
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:21,192
They'll thank us for taking
them to the promised land.

446
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:23,737
Time for a session.

447
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:28,285
- A session?
- A work session

448
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:30,957
to catch up on the status
of the Juno Project.

449
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:33,751
- Now?
- Yes, when we arrive,

450
00:27:33,794 --> 00:27:36,382
I have no doubt that the
crew will start celebrating.

451
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:38,593
With the loss of half the
crew, it's been a challenge

452
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:40,346
to find everyone's perfect genetic mate.

453
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:48,775
All this hard work and secrecy
for glorified matchmaking?

454
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:50,903
We have a very limited gene pool.

455
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:55,118
We can't just have people
pairing up with whoever they want.

456
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:57,622
It's the only way to
maintain genetic diversity.

457
00:27:57,663 --> 00:27:59,959
You know, to avoid
unnecessary birth defects.

458
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,297
- Stuff like that.
- Exactly.

459
00:28:02,337 --> 00:28:04,048
Hey, Cat, who's your match?

460
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:09,892
- I can't wait to meet him.
- He died with the command crew.

461
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:12,686
- I have to find someone new.
- Aww.

462
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:19,740
You do that. You find someone new.

Oh, no. Just me this time.

Uh, I mean, it was too close before.

she was being ridiculous.

I pushed her away.

bad choice, like your flings.

I'm not. You know I care for you.

494

It's just with Ark 1 and Proxima,
it's a second chance for Helena and me.

would forgive you for this one.

The only reason you two

is because you did the
right thing in the end.
